# CMake wrapper for bootstrapping purposes
# The bootstraped phase 1 CMake is not able to call specific commands with -E
# for more info on that see the comment in etc/cget/cget.sh #52-55.
#
# To avoid complex path manipulation a enviroment variable is used which
# points to the phase 1 CMake, this can be used to configure the sources and
# building the full phase 2 CMake.
